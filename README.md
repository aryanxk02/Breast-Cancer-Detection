# Breast-Cancer-Detection
This project aims to find out the best possible way to predict Breast Cancer using Machine Learning Algorithms. The different kinds of models that will be used would include Tree Based Classifiers, Regression Based and Probabality Based Models. The best possible model will be decided based on 3 Metrics which are Mean-Accuracy, F1-Score and AUC-Score.
